- Role hierarchy restrictions prevent unauthorized promotions
- Admin group restriction ensures commands are only executed in secure environment

**Role Hierarchy:**

- `admin` - Full AMA management access (create, edit, start, end, select winners, broadcast)
- `editor` - Can edit announcements, start/end AMAs, and select winners
- `host` - Can start/end AMAs and select winners (no creation or editing)
- `regular` - No bot management access (can only participate in AMAs)

### **Viewing User Permissions**

Use the `/access` command to view all users with elevated permissions:

```bash
/access
```

**Access Control:**
- Only `admin` and `super_admin` users can execute this command
- Must be used in the admin group

**Output Format:**
```
Super Admin(s)
‚Ä¢ Alice Johnson (123456789)
‚Ä¢ Bob Wilson (987654321)

Admin(s)
‚Ä¢ John Doe (456789123)

*Note: User IDs are displayed in monospace format for easy copying in Telegram.*

The command displays users grouped by their roles in descending order of permissions, with each user listed as a bullet point under their respective role category.

User name and username fields are automatically kept in sync with Telegram when any command or AMA question is received.
